================
MODIFIED VENDORS
================

If you make a change to vendored gem, plugin, or rails, you should note
which files here so we don't overwrite the changes during a Rails upgrade.

In the file itself, above the changes you made, should be in this format:

# CUSTOM EDIT
# Name - YYYY/MM/DD
# Reason for change(s)
# Summary of change(s)
new code here

If you can comment out the old lines then make changes in new code,
so we can compare the changes later, that would be beneficial.
