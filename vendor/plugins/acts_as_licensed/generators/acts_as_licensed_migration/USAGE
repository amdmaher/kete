Description:
    The ActsAsLicensed migration generator creates a migration for the License model.

    The generator takes a migration name as a first argument.  The migration name may be
    given in CamelCase or under_score.  'add_license_table' is the default.
    
    The generator creates a migration class in db/migrate prefixed by its number
    in the queue.

Example:
    ./script/generate acts_as_licensed_migration add_license_table

    With 4 existing migrations, this will create an ActsAsLicensed migration in the
    file db/migrate/005_add_license_table.rb
