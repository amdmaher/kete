ActsAsLicenced
=====================

Some portions (rails generator) based on work by Rob Sanheim in the BrainBuster rails plugin.


INSTALL
=======

Install the plugin by running

  script/plugin install git://github.com/kete/acts_as_licensed.git

Add the migration and update your database by running

  ./script/generate acts_as_licensed_migration
  rake db:migrate

Install the licenses you want to assign to content. See a list of them by running

  rake -D acts_as_licensed

Finally, add the following line to the controller which you want to add the licensed plugin to

  acts_as_licensed


ADDITIONAL INSTALLATION
=======================

ActsAsLicensed relies on three methods within the class you add acts_as_licensed to.

They are title_for_license, author_for_license, and author_url_for_license

The defaults are usually similar to the following (adjust to suit your application):

  def title_for_license
    title
  end
  def author_for_license
    self.author.name
  end
  def author_url_for_license
    "/site/account/show/#{author_id}"
  end

You can also define a default license by setting DEFAULT_CONTENT_LICENSE somewhere in your initializers (the constant contains the id of a license in the license table).


USAGE
=====

Class Methods
-------------

You can get a list of all available licenses by using

  License.find_available

----------------

Check whether the object has a license by using

  object.has_license?

Update the license, which raises an error if the object already have a license, by using

  object.license_id = id_of_new_license

  object.license_metadata

Helper Methods

  licenses_are_available?

Get the default license if configured else nil through

  configured_default_license

Iterate over each license using

  available_licenses do |license|
    puts license.name
  end

Helper methods for license selection in forms include:

  radio_button_for_license_selection(object_name, license)
  radio_button_with_label_and_image(object_name, method, tag_value, label, image_url = nil, options = {}, options_for_label = {})
  radio_button_with_label(object_name, method, tag_value, label, options = {}, options_for_label = {})
