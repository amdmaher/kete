== Creating the test database(s)

The tests can run against several databases. See the related test/connections/#{adapter}/connection.rb file
for information about expected connection settings. 

The sqlite tests are especially easy to run once the required gems are installed.

== Other Prerequisites

The mocha gem must be installed.

== Running with Rake

rake test       # runs tests against all databases
rake test:mysql # just runs mysql tests

rake -T   # See this for more info
