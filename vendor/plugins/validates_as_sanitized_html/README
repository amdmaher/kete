ValidatesAsSanitizedHtml
============

Written for  the Kete software (an open source Rails application for collaborative digital archives) by Walter McGinnis for Katipo Communications, Ltd. (http://katipo.co.nz/).

The general idea is to check the quality of user inputed HTML.

You may also be interested in the acts_as_sanitized plugin.

====
Requirements:

* Rails 2.0.2 or greater
* Hpricot gem

====
Usage:

In your model:

  validates_as_sanitized_html :the_user_submitted_html_attribute

You can also turn off  whether the  the attribute will
fail validation if there are  form, script, or input tags included in
the attribute on a record by record basis by adding a do_not_sanitize
virtual attribute in your model...

    attr_accessor :do_not_sanitize

Then in your controlle you may set do_not_sanitize to true if, for
example, a site admin is allowed to add forms.

Cheers,
Walter McGinnis
